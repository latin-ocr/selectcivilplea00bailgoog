ol the objects os the Society will be to supply, as lar as its means permit, a ·
complete collection os entries similar to those srom which these authors have
deduced their principles, with the view os enabling future writers to illus-
trate more amply the ancient propositions and principles ol the law, and to
correct the earlier text-writers in those instances in which, lrom being in

variations in the mode os procedure os the Court os Chancery as a
court os equitable jurisdiction, and are lull ol information as to the manners .
and customs ol the times, A lew specimens ol these early proceedings have
been printed by the Record CommissionerS, but a vast collection ol them
awaits lurther exploration. Α

The pleadings in the Ordinary or Common Law side ol the Court ol
Chancery exist -lrom a very early time, and consist ol proceedings in
