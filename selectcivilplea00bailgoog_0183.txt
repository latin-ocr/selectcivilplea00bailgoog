werde during the outlawry he was slain by his enemies
withan arros, and died an outlew. And Richard and his
wife say that [Reinward] never was outlawed, but in truth
he alienated himself from the country on account of his

enemics; and at length he came to Earl Reginald ¹ (who at
that time had the county² of Oornwall, and all things that
appertcin to the King as well concerning life and limb as
other things), and he afterwards came inte the peace and was
reconciled to him. And afterwards [Richard and Ihiethon]
admitted that [Reinward] was outlawed; but EarlReginald
pardoned his outlawry, and he then recovered scisiu of all
the lande which he had lost en the aforesaid occasion, and in
such seisin he died, being elain by his enemies withan
arrow. And the whole County testifica thet a'fter Earl
Reginafd had pardoned the outlawry‚ [Reinward] was again
outlawed for his crimes, and [while] an outlaw was after-
wards elain. And be it knownthat Reinward held no land
of thc said Ecrl Regincld‚ but of the Priory of Bodmin;
whereforc it would seem that, although the Earl could
pardon [Reinward] the outlawry‚ he could not give back to

¹ him the land, which was eo escheated to another. Itis
considered that [llliethon] has no right in that land, and
that she takes nothing by that assiae.

189. Theassizc comesto recognise if Thomas, the father of
William‚ was seised in his demesne as of fec of one ferling
’ 01 land with' oppurtenanees in Trevesccn [⁴2] the day that
he died, etc, which land Sybss, who was wife of Thomas,
holds. [Sybil] says that she claime nothing in that land
except deser, of the gift of the said Thomas. And Wilhun
fully admits that she was dowered thercof, as she says,
but he says that her husband had no more land, and
he prays the consideration of the Court whether [Thomas]
could endow her of the whole of his land. Judgment:
William takes nothing by that assiae, but he may seek a

writ of admensurement of dower against Sybil if he wish.
