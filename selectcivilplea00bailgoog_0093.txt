sucularum, ao. 1201. 32

70, The assiae comes to recognise what patron in the time
{Timr of peace presented the last parson to the church of Wood-
ford, which parson is dead; the advowson of which [church]

Ralph Basset demands against the Abbot of Rochester.
[The Abbot] comes and says that the churcb [of Woodford]
is not vacant, because his church [of Bochester] has had it
and possessed it ior thirty years and more, of the gift of
Osmund Basset and William Basset. And the Abbot shows
their charters; one whereof testifies that Osmund Basset
gave the church [of Woodford] to the church of Bochester
in pure [and perpetual alms]; and the other testifica that
William concedcd it to them as Osmund's gift. So that
Richard de Buchton, who last died, was perpetual vicar of
that church [Woodford] rendering to [the Abbot's] church
[of Rochester] two marks yearly. And against this Ralph
says that hs, after the obtaining of the said chariore, pre·
sented the said Richard to that church [Woodford], and
thereof hs puts himself upon the jury- The jury say thet ,s
Ralph presented the last parson; let him have a writ to
the bishop to admit his olsrlr.

71. Robert son of Alan complains that Gerard de Mal·
{Tm quincy [⁶2] in his [Robert'e] absence made a fine with John
Mauduit touchhrg the free tenement which he [Robert]
holds and cleims to hold of [Gerard] in Shuttlehangcr and
whereof he [Robert] has a charter of Gerard’s father, and

a charter of Gerard himself ; so that in consequence of the

fine made between them, the said John took the service of
Robert's men, which they were accuetomed to do to Robert
himself. Gerard came and admitted that he made the fine
with John Mauduit, so that by the fine he attorned the
service of Robert, aa much as [Robert] owed him, but not

the service of [Robert's] men. Therefore it is considered
that J ohn be summoned to be [here] on the morrow of S.
Martin, to show why he took the service of Roberl's men,
when it was not attorned to him, and let him then have his

chirograph there. Gerard puts in his place Henry Cumin.
