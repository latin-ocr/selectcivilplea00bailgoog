King's (lourt seems 66 6616 6666 instituted in the reign 61
Henry ΙΙ., 666 66 116116 61 that period are known. ln case
166111 6616 volume, the defendente put themselves on 666
16116 61 666 6166 year 61 666 reign 61 King Richard. No rolls
are known 66 66 extant for 66 early 6 year, but it is quite
possible that there are such among the rolls of uncertain
date. Most of these could, I believe, be accuratsly dated
with the aid 61 666 Feet of Fines, 666 611611 66666 1666 616
611 printed and indered, it is hopeless 66 make the attempt.
ln this way Ι 6616 ascertained Curia Regis Roll, No. 67
(1666 Coram Rege Roll, John, No. 66), which is undated,
66 66 61 Hilary Term in the fifth year.

Several rolls of Richard's reign heve been identified
during the recent examination and rearrangement 61 666
(loram Rege Rolls, though none 61 them are 61 very early
dete. Nos. 6, 63, 55, 66 (m. 2 only) and 69 (old numbers)
6616 now been transferred to this reign, and these, it is
understood, are 66 66 included in the Publicetions of the Pipe
Roll Society.

The rearrangement and renumberingof the Coram Rege
Rolls, though undoubtedly a great annoyance 66 6166, may
be ultimately of value. 166 66161 drawback is that 611 666
old references have become 166611666, and great difficulty
must be expected in consequence.

Still there is no doubt that in the Coram Rege Series

there were many Rolls which strictly speaking were not
Coram Rege Rolls at all, and had no right to be there.
Accordingly, the Coram Rege Rolls for the reigns 61
Richard 1., John, and Henry ΙΙΙ., and the series known as

Tower Assiae Rolls, or Tower Coram Rege Rolls, have now
been converted into two new series. 166 Rolls 61 Pleas,
whether before the Justices 61666 Bench 61 666 King, are ·
now known 66 Curia Regis 116116, and are numbered con·
secutively through those three reigns. The Rolls 61 Ρ1666
661616 the Justices in Eyre have now been sorted 666 and
formed into 6 new series known as ‘Assius Rolls, Various
Series,’ which 616 6166 numbered consecutively. 166 ex-
tracta for this volume were mode and printed before the
