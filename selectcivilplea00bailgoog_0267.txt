ln short, the whole legal life and much of the social life of a mediaeval ·
village is recorded in one way or another upon the Manor Rolls ln the
, Public Record Office there is a rich collection of these rolls many dating
from the reign of Edward l. and a few even from the reign of Henry lll., Ι
j'ss relating to manors which at one time or another came into the hands of the

ξὶῑ- Crown. lt is probable that there are rolls equally early in other libraries
and in private hands ; and about such the Council will be grateful for any
information. By the permission of the Council of King's College,
ss· Cambridge, the editor has been able to use a very ancient set of rolls
:2 belonging to the Abbey of Bec. The volume contains extracts from the
l* rolls of the manors in England of the Abbey of Bec in no less than thirteen .

rolls of his great honour of Broughton, which extended into seven shires;

n contain many curious cases concerning the merchant “communitates '' of
Huntingdon, Leicester‚ Nottingham‚ and other townS, and throw new light
r on “the law merchant”; also from the rolls of the Abbot of Battle's
r Manorial Court of 'Brightwaltham (Berks), and of the view of frankpledge

The third volume of the Society's publicatione, issued in respectos the

, Subscription for 1889, is a volume of Select Civil Pleas of the thirteenth
3 century from the Plea Rolls preserved in HM. Public Record Office‚ edited
‚ with a translation by Mr. W. Paley Baildon, of Lincoln’s lnn. Some
ζ account of these Rolls is given by Professor Maitland in his Introduction
κ to the first volume of the Society’s publications. The Civil Cases for the ι
1 most part consist of actions relating directly or indirectly to land, of writs

of right, writs of entry, actions for dower and the like; the various
“Assizes” (Mort d'ancestor, Novel disseisin, Last Presentation, dte.) are
very frequent. ln these actions the title of the litigants is often set out
with much detail. Sometimes it is traced to the Conquest ; and at times
reference is made to Domesday Book. Among the actions indirectly
concerning land may be instanced those. to enforce feudal services, for
warranty of land, disputes about levying tolls infringement of franchises‚
obstruction of rivers and so forth. Among cases not concerning land
there may be mentioned an early case of Boycotting in 1200, and an action
for breach of promise of marriage somewhat later. This volume, like the
recent volume of Pleas of the Crown, will begin with the year 1200, the
point at which the Rotulz' Currite Regis, edited by Sir Francis Palgrave
for the Record CommissionerS, comes to an end, and will well illustrate
how new writs wcre devised when occasion required, and will thus display

the gradual evolution of the various “forms of action‚'' real and persona
