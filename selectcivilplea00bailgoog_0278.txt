to describe parcels whether used with a technical meaning or not, should be
included. When the materials have been collected and are ready sor
editing, it may be necessary to place some limits to the dates os the words
to be included in the dictionary‚ or it may even be necessary to have two
dictionaries‚ the one os earlier and the other ol later terms ; but the Council
think it better to leave the decision ol these and other questions until the

materials have been collected.

lt is obvious that quotations are required sor the illustration os all
words ; and the collection of slips should be begun at once.

The following rules sor the guidance os workers are copied srom those
adopted by the Philological Society. They are sound to work extremely
well in practice.

The most important os these rules is Rule 1. Itis absolutely necessary
that all the slips used should be os the same size and sorm. The right size
is precisely 7 inches by 43, this being the commonest size os note-paper.
lt this is at all varied srom, trouble is caused ; but it may be remarked that
a sheet slightly under this size can, in practice, be sorted in with therest, and.
tied up in bundles ; whilst a sheet a little over the right size causes a great
deal os annoyance, and is liable to be cut or partly torn away. The bundles
os slips should be tied up with tape‚ and should be llanked on both sides by
protecting pieces ol millboard, ol the same size as the slips themselves

As only leals-sheets are required, and the writing is to be on one side
only, it is osten possible to use up halves os old letters. There may even
be writing οτ printing on the other side ; only it should be crossed out.

MECHANICAL AND PRACTICAL REGULATIONS.

t. Each word or phrase should be written out with its quotation and the full
reference on a separate half-sheet of note-paper, lengtlzeelse, end on ene side

of tlze peperoeely.* ’ ,
[Ν.Β.-Α ream os common note-paper costs 25.; this should contain -

480 sheets and 960 half-sheets, thus admitting ol the registration of 960
words at a trifling expense]

lt is most eernestly reqnesled tleet tlzis rule moy be strictly end undem·-
atiegly followed, ils object being lo enable tlte Ede'tors to sort tlte eareous
contrt'bete'ons el once into elpleaben'cal groeps, end so to prevent tlte accumu-
lollons of matter from betornieg umnaeegeeble.
