Lords Marchers‚ and in relation to which an enormous mass of unex-
plored evidence exists in the Cottonian collection; the great Court of
Star Chamber; the Court of RequestS, with an interesting series of
, records little known to legal antiquarieS, except by the illustrative cases
edited at the end of the sixteenth century by Sir Julius Caesar, a work which
- is now very rare3 the Council of the North, founded in 1 5 36, and reorganised
in τό 32 by Lord Strafford, a monograph of which would be of great interest
to Yorkshire antiquaries; the Stannary CourtS, and the Court of the

Staple both at London and Calais two institutions which illustrate the ¹

, rise of the commercial greatness of this country in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries; the Court of Castle Chamber at Dublin and others, allos which
will serve to illustrate the history of the incroachments of the extraordinary
jurisdiction of the Crown.

The origin of Mercantile and of luternational law might be fully illus-
trated from the evidence of mediaeval and Tudor State Papers, and it is
hoped to compile a collection of precedents from these and other sources.

The Anglo-Saxon laws form another sphere of work that should not be
neglected. ln the words of the Bishop of Onford¹ '“ such documents are
generally obscure, requiring sor their elucidation- a knowledge of the
customs they were intended to amend, which is not easily attainable.” Here
the documents themselves have to be carefully collated, analogies to the
Carlovingian or other systems have to be sought for and noted ; and the vast
mass of illustrative matter which modern archaeological and historical
research has brought to light has to be arranged and utilised. Passing· to
such compilations as the laws of ‘⁴ Edward the Confessor ” and of “ Henry
the First,” we find in them attempted codes of common law and custom,
which require to be studied in connexion with Domesday Book. Early
charters have hitherto been comparatively little studied, and Madox's
Formulare has clearly shown how valuable is their evidence for the
history and development of legal formulas. Scattered also through early
cartularies is a rich store of references to, and descriptions of, early suits
and pleadings almost from the time of Domesday Book. All these require
collection on a scientific and systematic plan. Borough custumals and
records of suits in which municipalitics have been engaged, both in print
and in MS. have to be examined and will be found occasionally to supply
rnaterials which would elsewhere be sought in vain.

The question is not so much what to include as where to begin.

A Volume on the origin of the King's Courts is much to be desired.

The archaeologyof the subject is almost a blank. Little that is definite ·i

is known of their official procedure before the thirteenth century; yet there
