to have of the gift of John, her [late] husband, by the wish -

· and consent of the said John’s lether, who on the day that

she was married gave and granted that land to his son to
endow her;¹ and John was seised thereos, end endowsd
her thereos, and gave her seisin thereos at the chureh porch
by a certain broken knife, which she shows. And Matthew
comes and defends that [J ohn's] father never granted that
land to his son, nor gave it, nor was his son seised thereos,
nor was [John's] father present at that wedding, nor could
he grauior give‘that land, because [a certain part oi] it
was the inheritanes 0f=[J0hn’s] mother, which fell to her in
her reasonable portion against her sistere, because there
were eight sistere, and they partitioned their inheritance
amongst thern, so that the eighth part remained to his
mother ; and [Matthew] says that John, her husband, never
had seisin of that land, and that after the death of John
his father held that land lor ten years, and aiter the death
of his father his mother held that land twelve ysars; and
he, Matthew‚ after the death of his motherhas now held it
ten years; and he says that he afterwards [made] an
agreement with his aunts, so that the whole ol the land
which belonged to the said sistere remained to him. And ’
Amice says that he unjustly defends this, and thet the

of tho country, whether she was endowed as aforesaid, and
craves a Jury oi the country thersof3 and if she cannot

have a Jury of the* country thereos, she offers to deraign .

this by living voice, who offers to deraign the sams. And
Matthew deiende the whole ol it, end prays that it may be
allowed in his favour that the urit only speaks of reason·

she seeks by word of mouth hall the town oi Normanton
and hall the town oi Eston. It is considered that the writ
be quashed because she demands by word oi mouth another
thing then she demands by her writ; end let her seck
