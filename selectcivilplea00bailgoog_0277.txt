SCHEME FOR THE COLLECTION OF MATERIALS FOR THE DICTIONARIES
OF ANGLO-FRENCH AND OF LAW TERMS.

· The best name for the language of the French MSS. written in
England is, from a philological point of vieW, chno-Fnawctt. The term
Norman is objectionable, as it may be confused with the Norman of the
Continent, from which Anglo-French gradually diverged, owing to its peculiar
locality and use.

Anglo-French is chiefly used for legal matters, but not exclusively ; we
find also histories, romances, and poems. It would be highly desirable to
make a complete list of all the MSS. and books existing in Anglo-French,
orat any rate of all the editions. A list of the unpublished MSS. might be
made later.

ln compiling a Dictionary of the language, by far the best plan is to
follow, as far as is deemed convenient, the method which has been so ’
successfully employed for the construction of the New English Dictionary,
now being edited by Dr. Murray. This is the only feasible plan by which
a satisfactory result can be obtained. .

ln order to make a complete Dictionary of the whole. language it will
be necessary to take some 'notice of every word; but when the same word
recurs it need not be again noticed, unless there is some variation in the
mode of its use, or in the sense or in the spelling.

lt may be remarked here that the very words which are perfectly
intelligible to the modern Englishman, because they have found their way
into English itself, are precisely those which are of most interest and
importance to the English philologist; but, in the compilation of a glossary
only, they would probably receive but small attention.

II. Tua Dtcmownnv ov an Tamus,

The want of a good dictionary of law terms has long been felt as well
by practising lawyers as by antiquaries and historica] students Existing
law dictionaries are in many ways imperfect. The publication of mediaeval
records and documents has thrown open to our generation many sources of
information which until of late years were not accessible; and it is hoped
that by the co-opetation of scholars who are willing to read one or more
books and to collect quotations, a dictionary may be prepared which shall
contain the results of modern research.

Itis desirable to collect materials on the widest possible scale. All
technical legal terms, all words common in legal forms, and all words used
