FOUNDED 1887.

The Selden Society has been formed to encourage the study and
advance the knowledge os the History of English Law. This will at first
be carried into effect mainly by collecting and editing in a convenient form
materials for students to work upon in their own way. Vast stores of
material of the most valuable kind, illustrative of the growth and the
principles of the mediaeval common law, lie buried in unindexed and
uncalendared records of the realm at the Public Record Office, and in

unpublished MSS. in public and. private libraries; and one main object
of this Society will be to collect and publish selections from these records

and manuscripts,

But although publishing will thus be the chief objectos the Society, it
isproposed to hold meetings frorn time to time sor the receiving of reports
of work done or in progress, the reading of papers and the discussion of
other matters of interest; though it is not proposed at present to spend any ·
money in printing papers or transactions.

A short account of some of the principal classes of records which may
be dealt with by the Society will serve to show how wide a field lies open
to its labours

First in importance and judicial authority are the Plea Rolls of the
Courts of King's Bench Common Pleas and Exchequer‚ including the
Rolls of the Curia Regis of which the earliest in existence is of the sixth
year of Richard l. The earlier portion of the Rotuli Curiae Regis up to
and including the first year of John, have been printed in full by the
Record CommissionerS, and the continuation of this publication, either in
extenso or in the form os selections would be an appropriate undertaking
for the Society, although the records of a somewhat later period are perhaps
more full of interest. The later pleadings and judgments are the most
authentic materials for English legal history. They throw great light both

upon the state of the law and the social and economic condition of the
