ΜΝ virgatesoflandwithappurtenancesinWhipsnadeashisright
and inheritance, which ought to descend to him from Gilbert
his great-grandfather, who was seised thereos in demesne as
os fec and right on the year and day on which Henry the
grandfather of the King's father died, taking manes thereos
to the value os five shillings and four penca, and more ;
(and be it known that from Gilbert it ought to descend to
Alsred [?], and from Alfred to Richard, [Gilbert’s] father) ;
and this he offers to deraign against [Simon] by a certain
free man os his, Ralph the Forester, who offers 10 provo this
as os the view and by the command os his father, Robert,
etc. Simon comes, and defends [Gilbert’s] right ; and says
that [Gilbert] unjustly demands that land against him,
because formerly one Gervase de Windsor‚ a relative os
Gilhert’s, demanded that land as that which ought to
descend to him from the sams Gilbert [the great-grand·
father] os whoseseisin the land is now demanded, and it
was at last agreed between them, before the King’s J ustices‚
to wit, Ralph de Glanville, Richard Bishop of London‚
Richard Bishop of Winchester, and Hubert Bishop of
Salisbury, that afine was made between them, anda
chirograph was made in the King's (lourt, and by that fine
the land remained tobim [Simon]; and he vouchss the

Gourt [to warranty] thereos, because he cannot produce the
chirograph, for the reason that a certain William, to whom
he had given his daughter in marriage, on account os the
agreement, which he [William] said thathe [Simon] had not
kept, came to his house, and broke it, and carried off the
chirograph, together with other chattels. And is this will not
suffice, he offers to defend it by a certain free man os his,

Reginald the (lhild, who [offers to defend the same], etc.
Gilbert comes, and cravss the considerationes the Court in-
asmuch as Simon vouches the King's Gourt and the chiro-
graph, and does not produce the chirograph3 and hs says
that Gervase was 1101 able or entitled to do anything by
which he [Gilbert] should lose his right. Aday is given
them on the oetave of Martinmas at Westnrinster to hear

⁶ their judgment.
