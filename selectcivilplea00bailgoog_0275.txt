are many scattered and unique fragments that would supply much ol the
knowledge that is wanted. For lack os this knowledge Selden and others os
old may have sallen into error. Madox and Palgrave did something to fill
the gap. Something further in the same direction may be hoped to be
accomplished. A

lt is hoped also to publish new editions os Glanville, Bracton,
Fleta, the Mirror, and other ancient treatises. The mass ol valuable
material which has never yet been printed is, however, so large that at
· first the Society may devote its attention mainly to this, rather than to
books which, in however imperfect a formare already in print; but the
claim ol these books to be well edited will not be neglected. There are
· also many “ readings ’¹ by famous lawyers which have never been printed,
and some of these well deserve publication as being concise and systematic
expositions os various branches ol the law. ’

Itis proposed that the records published by the Society shall, asa
general rule, be accompanied by translations and lurnished with carelully

will, it is hoped, beat once begun. The Coun'cil desire to call special
attention to the practical instructions, kindly drawn up by Professor W. W.
Skeat, sor the collection ol these materials. ls these instructions are
caresully adhered to, the collections will become a most valuable index
to the whole os our law. When the collections are sufficiently complete sor
printing-a matter doubtless· of many years-they will be handed over lor
editing to some competent philologist. Until then they will be kept in some
convenient place where scholars may have access to them at all reasonable
times; and it is even possible that arrangements may be made by which
scholars at a distance, who are unable to consult them in person, may be
informed os their contents on any particular subject.

The Council will be glad to receive offers of help in editing the
Society's publications and in collecting materials sor the Dictionaries, as well
as any information as to the custody and contents os any MSS. that ought
to be dealt with by the Society. '

Considering that English law constitutes one ol the great systcms ol
jurisprudenceos the world, not restricted to England and lreland, but being
the origin and model ol the institutions ol the United States and os our
Colonies, the importance which attaches to its due investigation can hardly
be exaggerated. hluch light may also be thrown, as the English materials
