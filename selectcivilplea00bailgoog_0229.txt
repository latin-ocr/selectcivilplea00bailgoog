254, Simon Waleys, Robert, son oi Nioholas, Robert Fleming,
³⁰¹¹²¹¹¹⁸b¹² Alexander Duce, and Reginald, son of Harvey-reoognitors
[in an assiae] of novel dieresin taken at Ipswioh, before the
King’s J ustioes, between the Prior oi S. Neot’s andMatilda, .
mother oi William de Eu, touohing a certain bank thrown
up in Hardwiok,—were summoned to be before the J ustioes
at Bedrord, to oertiiy to them what they had given to
Matiida touohing the bank. They aomo and say that in
truth the Prior had unjustly and without judgment raised
three braye to the damage oi Matilda’s free tenement in
Hardwiok, to wit, one at one head of the darn, another at
the other head oi the dam, and the third near the plaoe
where Matiida's [water·]gates are raised in the dam whioh
has been taken down. And being asked ii those brays were
raised oi new¹ earth or of the dam whioh fell down, they
say they were raised upon the dam whioh was there first.
And being asked to what damage, they answer that their
fellows gave them to understand that [the braye] were
raised to Matilda’s damage, unjustly and without judg·
ment, and they say that the [water·]gates cannot be raised
in the dam beoause oi them, and that she took down her
first dam on aooount oi them. A day is given them in the
quindena oi Martinmas at westminster, and let William
Garbod‚ one of tho reooguitors, who did not oome, be
attached.

¹ This appears to bs the meaning, bnt the whole osse is obscure.
