· of entry, actions for (lower, end the like, and the various
‘Assizee’ (1110111101101101,110001 (1111011111, Dorrer'e presente·
11101010.) are most frequent. Personal actions 11000111-
paratively rare, though several will be found in thia
volume. Iheve peid particular attention to actions 01 thie
class, end have copied nearly ell Ifound3 00 that their
rarity in this volume will show what a very small propor-
tion they bear to the mess of litigation concerning land.

I am not avare that the inaccuracy 01 the Plea
Belle hasbeen touched upon before, but a word ef werning
is certainly necessary. The scribes who wrote the rolls
were but mortal‚ and made many mistakes. It is only in
a few cases that we heve anything to correct them by.
01100100 in this volume 10 a continuation of earlier pro-
ceedings which ere printed in Rotuli Curiae Regis. ln vol.

case 91 in this volume, it 10 spelled Tiueleslry, andin
case 119, Timelebr'. Other examples of inaccurecy will bc
found in this volumc; for instance, compare ceses 9
1111144.

Ι have followed Prof. hlaitland’s arrangement in
seperating the cases before the Justices in Eyre from the
cases before the Courts et westminster, but it must not
therefore be supposed thet there was any difference either
in the class 01 cases coming before tlre two tribunale, or in
the procedure 01 1110 courts.

In the following remarks I have called attention to
some 01 the most striking ceses.

Oase 6 is one 01 gavellrind in Norfolk. The demandent
claims ‘the reasonable portion which falls to him of his
father's inhe1·itance;’ this is 1110 usual form of action
relating to a share of gavelkind lands.
