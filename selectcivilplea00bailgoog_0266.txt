administration of the Common Law by the King's JusticeS, and the many
desects in the great statutes os Edward l.’s reign.

The first publication os the Society, recently issued in respectos the
Subscription lor 1887, is a volume of Thirteenth Century Pleas os the
Crown‚ srom the Rolls preserved in H.M. Public Record Office, edited,
with a translation, by Mr. F. W. Maitland, Downing Professor of the Laws
os England, Cambridge. Many os these criminal cases are very interesting,
and they throw more light than cases os almost any other class on the
manners and customs os the people. They are not, however, on that
account the less valuable from the point ol view os the legal historiari.
The criminal cases in the Year Books are not many, and yet they
have to fill the long interval between Bracton and Staundlord. The
volume begins with the year 1200, and contains many cases srom the
{llltilllcllllsltl‘thl⁰lhss¹¹t0l⁰tllhtsplltlhtlffll‘t
reign, which may serve to show how a substitute for the ordeals was
gradually found in trial by jury. Though lor the most part the cases are
cases of selony‚ still many os the grievances redressed by the Great Charter
are illustrated, and care has been taken to collect whatever throws new
light on the procedure os the ancient Local Courts, the system os srank-
pledge, the representation os counties and boroughs for judicial purposes,
the condition os the towns, their corporate privileges and the like.

The second volume os the Society’s publications, issued in respectos
the Subscription lor 1888, is a volume os Select Pleas in Manorial and
other Seigniorial Courts srom the earliest Manorial Rolls extant, edited
with a translation by Mr. F. W. Maitland. The term Manorial Rolls
may perhaps hardly give a sair impression os the contents of these
records. Only a small part os them is taken up by conveyancing
entries, such as surrenderS, admittances and the like By lar the greater
part is taken up by eontentious proceedings; and these are os many
different kinds. ln the first place there are the actions sor land held by
villein services, and disputes between the lord and his tenants as to services
and rights os common, and similar matters. ln the second place, there

leet jurisdiction. The first sta es ol a criminal prosecution osten take
place in the Local Courts, and tlte pettier offences are punished there, the 2
King's Courts hardly as yet intersering with any crime which falls short os
selony. The mediaeval law as to offences answering to our modern

misdemeanours and offences punishable upon summary conviction must be ¹

lound in the Rolls os the Local Courts, which were in truth the police courts

of the neighbourhood. The procedure belore these local tribunals is ol very Ἴ

great interest, as it preserved many archaisms which had disappeared srom
the King’sCourts before the time at which our extant records begin. . Lastly,
the who e system os local police, ol srankpledge and so forth, rs displayed.
