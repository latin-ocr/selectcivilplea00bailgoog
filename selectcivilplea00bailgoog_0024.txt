Oase 87. Whena case was doubtful, and the Justices did
001 care to decide it at ‚the hearing, it seems to have been
the practice to have a consultation 00 the matter. ' ln one
case (87) the King is 10 10 consulted whether the assiae
ought 10 proceed or not. The ‘King’ here probably
means the King in Oouncil. ln another case (No. 190), a
point of law was reserwed 10 10 discussed by the Council
· (discuciatur per conciliant); this seems clearly 10 10000 the
King’s Council.¹ 10 a case 10 a later roll, Coram Rege Bell,

No. 17 (now Assize Bell, Varioua Series, 80), m. 14d, the

ι Justices in Eyre adjourned the case in order 10 consult

Sir Geoffrey Fita Peter, the Ohiel J usticiar. See also case
181. There are several cases in Bracton’s Note Booh3 in
No. 262, the King and the Justiciar are 10 10 consulted;

Case 120 10 very obscure, and Ι venture 10 suggest the
following explanation. The Abhols of Westminster and
Pershore had 001010 01 the Hundred ol Pershore.² The
Abbot of Westminater had also 0 piece of land in Pershore
where he was wont to hold his Hundred Court. This piece
of land apparently adjoined the Abbey Church 01 Pershore.

, The Abbot 01 Pershcre claimed this land as the church-

yard ol his church, and, in pursuance 01 this claim, the
Dean³ buried a corpae there. The Abhot of Westminster
complained of this, and brought an assiae 0100001110001010.
The Abbot 01 Pershcre first pleaded that the land was his
churchyard, but he afterwards abandoned that plea, and
admitted the land to 10 the Abbot 01 Westminster'a free
tenement and the site ol his Hundred Court.
