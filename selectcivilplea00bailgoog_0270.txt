people; and as very many of the judgments give the rabones dect'dmdi
upon which the Court proceeded, they will not only be interesting as
illustrations of legal history, but will also supply available precedents on
many questions still frequently litigated in the Courts relating to rights
of common, marketS, fisheries, tolls dcc, 3ηά will moreover be of great ’
use in illustrating the growth of many principles of the law the origin of
which is obscure. A few of these valuable records have been made to
some degree accessible, but in a very imperfect and inadequate manner,
by the “Abbreviatio Placitorum” printed by the Record Commissioners.
The extracts there given are very scanty. being in fact only a portion of a
large mass of short notes entered in a kind of Commonplace Book by
Agarde and other keepers of the Records in the time of Queen Elizabeth,
the remainder of which is in the Public Record Office. They are moreover
so brief that it is impossible in most cases to discover the true value of the
record without having recourse to the original, 3 labour requiring so much
time 3ηά such special palaeographical knowledge that, for the practical
purposcs of the general student, these records remain a sealed book.
A glance at the Index Rerum of the “ Abbreviatio Placitorum ” will show
more clearly than can be done in the present prospectus the importance of
publishing selections from these records in greater detail and in a more
complete form. Ι

It is also proposed to print extracts from the Eyre Rolls 3ηά Assize
Rolls with the view of illustrating the state of the criminal law in early
times. These records extend from the reign of Henry lll. to that of
Henry VI. inclusive; and from. them it is expected that much valuable
matter will be derived, which will no doubt assist in clearing up the many
difficult points 3ηά doubts arising from the obscure language and imperfect
entries of the reports found in the printed Year Buoks. The criminal cases

in the Year Books are not many, and yet they have to fill the long interval ἕ

between Bracton and Staundford. Many points are still obscure, and none
more so than the history of the petty jury. By the publication of these

records we ought tobe able to trace the precise process by which the twclve
hundredors and four townsmen of 'Bracton became the two juries of a later

time·It may be here remarked that Coke, Selden, Hale, and other writers

now received as more or less authoritative, depended very much in

their turn on the records above mentioned, to which however they l

seem to have had but very imperfect access. Hale, in particular, quotes χ
largely from them, and when he states a proposition os law he generally '
