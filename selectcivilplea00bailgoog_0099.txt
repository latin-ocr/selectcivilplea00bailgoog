cremae? Richard de Throngham, put in the place of Hardwin ,
his father, demanded against Robert Achard that he should
do the forinseo service for one virgata ol land with apporte-
nanoes in Througham; which [land] remained to the said

‚ Robert by the chirograph made between him [Robert] and
the aforesaid Hardwin touching half a hide of land, con-
cerning which there was a plea between them in the King's

Court; and [Robert and Hardwin] came before the J astices,

and agreed that each of them shall defend the land which

he holds.

On the Quindene of Michaelmas.

78· William de Longchamp offered himself on the fourth
day against Hubert son of Reginald of a plea ol vil-
lenage which he exacted against [Hubert] for the land
which [Hubert] holds of him in Habertoft [?], and which
Hubert’s father held of Guy de Crouna, by servile tenure,
as hc says, and which Hubert himself afterwards [held]
by servile labour. Hubert shows a certain charter ol Guy
de Crouna, the tenor of which is [as follows] :-Bs it
known to all that I, Gnyde Grouna, have remised to Hubert
son of Reginald for four years, in consideration of the ser-
vice of Dionisia, his wife, all customs appertaining to the
land which he holds of me, except the accustomed pay-
ment which appertains to Hubert’s land, to wit, fifteen
penca per aunum, to wit, at Hester five penos, at the feast -
cf S. Botolph five penae, and at the feast of S. Andrew five
penos. And if Ishall not return from the land of Jeru-

Idneoln

salem within the said four years, the aforesaid land shall
romain to the said Hubert, my free man, sale and quit, to
hold to him and his heire of me and my heirs in fes and
inheritance‚ peaceably‚ freely, and quit, by the aforesaid

service for all service except the forin'sec service of our lord

the King. This gift I have made to him and his heirs in ,
consideration of the service of Dionisia, his said wife.
These being witnesses, etc. And because fflubert] hada

day in Banc, and did not keep his day, it is considered

that William has deraigned all his exaction.
