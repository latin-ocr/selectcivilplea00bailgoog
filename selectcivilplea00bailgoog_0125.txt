L³¹¹⁰⁰¹¹¹ Kirkstead, offered himself on the fourth day against Her·
bert de S. Quintis of a plea of three carucates and a half of

120. The assiae comes to recognise if the Abbot of Pershore
mmm has unjustly and without judgmont disseieed the Abbot of

Westminster of his free tenement in Pershore within the
assiae. The Abbot of Pershore says thet [the land] is the
churchyard of his ehureh, and not the free tenement of· the
Abbot of Westminster. Afterwerds the said Abbot [of
Pershore] puts himself upon the assiae. Afterwards the
said Abbot [of Pershore] comes and granta to the Abbot of
Westminster the seisin of the site of the hundred, as he
had it (and where he wae wont to have it), and says that

· he does not wish to deprive [him of it], and that the site
was not taken away by him, and that the corpse which was
last buried there, whereof [the Abbot of Westminster] com-
plains, was not buried there by him, but by the Dean of
the Bishop. And so they mehe a concord.
