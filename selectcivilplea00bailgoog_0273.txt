contents, with extracts and notes, has yet to be prepared.

The continuation os the publication os the proceedings and ordinances
os the Privy Council, that is to say the renewal and completion os the
work ol Sir Harris Nicolas, would be no small service. There are lew
gaps in the Privy Council Registers, and a study ol thern might throw
much new light on the history of one os the most important, and, it may
be added, most obscure os English institutions.

The records ol the Courts in which the Canon Law was administered
in this country, so sar as they still exist, would probably be ol high interest;
and it is hoped that the Society may herealter find means os inquiring into
them, and is they should be lound ol value os publishing some extracts srom
them. A well-known passage in Chaucer’s Friar's Tale, descriptive ol the
jurisdiction ol an Archdeacon's Court, can hardly sail to whet the appetite of
the investigator into the laws and manners and customs ol our ancestors :-

How lar such an'investigation is likely to prove fruitsul is as yet a
question on which the Council has formed no opinion.
The jurisprudence and practice ol the Manorial Courts being os great

interest to the constitutional and social historian should be illustrated by
the records that escaped the incendiaries os 1381. With these might
be included an account ol the Courts os the Forest and ol Forest Law, the
jurisdictions of the Palatine counties, including the Duchy Courts, and such
franchises as Ely, which enjoyed jura regalia, and the interesting franchises
os the Lords Marchers on the Welsh borders, together with the peculiar
customs which prevailed within the Scotch bordevs.

The origin and jurisdiction ol the anomalous Court's ol Council which
incroached upon the province ol the Common Law would well repay further
investigation, especially as several os these possess a very lull collection os
records. Amongst these may be mentioned the Council of the West and
marches ol Wales which runs¹ parallel with the decaying franchises ol the
