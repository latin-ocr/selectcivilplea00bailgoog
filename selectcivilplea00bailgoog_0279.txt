2. The edition made use of should be stated once for all by written communi·
cation to the Honorary Secretary, and throughout adhered to; and in the
references, author’s name and treatise‚ page, chapter and section, and verse
where existing, should be given. The date or approximate date of the
original work should be prefixed to the reference. In the specimen ou page 20,
“ab. 1290¹' signifies “about 1290 A.D.'' Such references can, in some cases,
be printed, all but the variable numbers.

3. An earlier edition of a work should be preferred to one more recent, where
choice is practicable ;—this, however, is merely intended as a general rule,
and must be subject to the circumstances of each particular case.

4. ln transcribing quotations the original spelling must always be preserved;
and when any words are for brevity’s sake omitted, the omissions must be
signified by dots. Moreover, each quotation must be extensive enough to carry

. a complete sense by itsclf,· mere fragments of sentences enclosing a particular
word are unintelligible and useless and, in fact, are not quotations at all.

5. Where a quotation contains two or more noteworthy words, phrases dcc, it
must be retranscribed sor eaclr. It would be of great convenience if the
readers for the Law Dictionary would give in [ ] any other references that
they know to the words which do not appear to them to be of sufficient

. importance to require retranscription of the quotation. This may save much
time to the Editor. lt would be well also where the passage transcribed
has cases referred to in the margin to state the result of their investigation‚
if they have examined them. This may again save much time, especially
if the results are negative. ¹

6. lt is requested that all persons who may feel disposed to undertake any
work or works will be kind enough to signily their intention to the Honorary
Secretary, and at the same time to mention the name or title of the work
or works they may select lor investigation‚ so that two persons may not be
‚engaged in traversing the same ground.

7. Contributors are particularly requested to arrange their work in alphabetical
order before sending it in to the Honorary Secretary.

8. As regards etymology, nothing should at present be attempted. It can only
be considered when the final compilation takes place. But all quotations
which illustrate either the true or the popular etymology of a given word
will be particularly acceptable.
