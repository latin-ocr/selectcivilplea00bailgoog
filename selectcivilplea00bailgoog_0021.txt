Cass 61 is one of gavelkind in Rutlandshire, where I
believe this eustom has not before been noted ; the tenant's
plea is curione, that the land was a soeage and could
not be partitioned.

Cass 7 is one of what is now called ‘Boyootting ’; the
demandant’s plen, that ‘no one dare till that land because
of the tonant, and that she eould not deul with it in any
wey beeause ol him‚’ is very suggestive ol some ol the
modern cases; so is the motivo which led to the boyootting
——the land had been reoovered against the defendant by
judgment of the Court.

Cass 106 is somswhat similar. Tharais a similar oasa
in Seleet Pleas of the Crown, vol. i.‚ No. 178.

(lass 13 is one relating to the advowson of a convent,

where the demandant claimed that the convent was situated ·

in his property and that he ought to have the right of pre·
sentation of the Priore, as his ancestors, who were the
founders, had.

In ease 16 there is an instance of a mode ol investiture
very rare'in England, that is, per arlllollorn fractora. Inves-
titure per coltellum is not very rare in this country, several
examples are given in Ducange, av. Inresttnun, and more
might, no doubt, be oolleoted; but Ι have not been able to '
find any example ol ths ‘broken knilo' being used in Eng-
land, other than the ons in ease 16. Why a knife should
be used at all as a symbol of dslivery is not very clear, and
why it should be broken is still more obscure. 'l'he reason
given byDuoange is as follows z—At ‘com interdum ejusmodi
traditionum symbolo propter neomartyri, sarto seraa, erl
perire possent, ut liuto curreretur incommodo, reddebantur· eo
lautitia, oo fronpebunntr3 and to support this view, hs
quotes from William ol Malmesbury a case of King Edgar
who caused a staff (lituus) to be out in two, ne eom cuiquam
dore rel rendere posset quilibet. Another instance thera
given which supporta this view is taken from the Tabu-
larium S. Hilarii Pictaviensis3 in this ease the knife was
placed on the altar, qui ne quondo forsitan usui esset illico
