54. Alexander Barr complains that Simon son of Richard

Norlolk

cnjustlydowered Agnes Page ol the third part of the monor
of West Winch while there was a plea between Alexander
and Agnes tonching the dower of Agnes, and against the
prohibition of the Justices. And the attorney of Simon
comes and says that by the precept of the Sheriff of Nor·
lolk hs made seisin to [Agnes], and he shows a writ to
Richard de Gosfield then Sheriff, in which it is contained
that the Shoriff of Norlolk shall make to Agnes her reason·
able dower, endon account of that writ he made seisin
to her. And the Sheriff, being questioned, warrants to
[Simon] that by the precept ol the J ustioes he made seisin
to her thereos, and he produces the¹ writ ol the Justices,
which commands that he should cause her to have her
reasonable dower. Alexander puts in his place Richard
Ferre, etc. It is considered that Agnes may have and may
hold her dower until Alexander, who makes himsell the
heir of his brother Arnold, shall acquire that inheritance,
if he can make himself heir.
